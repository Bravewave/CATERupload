# CATERupload
This is a repository for my 3rd year dissertation project, as part of my MComp degree. The code within is for a web portal, allowing users to upload a video file to a remote server which runs that video through various command line processes, then returns the processed video to the use via a Google Drive upload. 

## Project Background
CATER (Combined Animal Tracking & Environment Reconstruction) is a computer vision framework developed by collaborators at Munster University and the University of Sheffield with the goal of facilitating small animal tracking. Given a top-down video of a moving subject against a complex background, it both calculates a trajectory for that object through the use of unaries as well as creating a mosaic from the video frames to match that trajectory.

The software is designed by computer scientists to solve a technical problem and as a result its barrier to entry limits its appeal to its target audience (that being researchers and scientists in the field, as well as roboticists). This project is a proof-of-concept showing that it is possible to employ a remote solution for interfacing with the CATER software, thereby making it a far more widely accessible tool.

More information can be found on CATER's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LarsHaalck/CATER) and [its paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adg3679) in Science Advances journal.
